## Reference Apps and Their Limitations

### Gnosys

**Usage:**  
AI app using computer vision and neural networks to translate sign language into speech and text.

**Problems:**  
- **Embarrassment:** Users may feel uncomfortable with a smartphone pointed at them for translation.
- **Hesitation:** The need to hold the phone in front of the sign language speaker can cause awkwardness.

### HandTalk App

**Usage:**  
Translates text or audio into sign language using a 3D model.

**Problems:**  
- **Lack of Audio Output:** Cannot produce audio from sign language, limiting communication with non-sign language users.
- **Manual Operation:** Requires manual recording of voice by deaf users, which is cumbersome.
- **No Recommendations:** Lacks a system for recommending commonly used words or phrases.

### SignAble

**Usage:**  
A video calling app for communication within the deaf community.

**Problems:**  
- **Commercial Costs:** May be costly and not affordable for all users.
- **Not a Translator:** Focuses on video calling rather than translating between sign language and spoken language.

### Audio to ISL App

**Usage:**  
Provides bidirectional translation between audio and sign language with learning modules and recommendations.

**Problems:**  
- **Not Automated:** Requires manual interaction for translation, leading to communication latency.
- **Limited Recommendations:** Recommendations are based only on the provided ISL dataset.

### Ava

**Usage:**  
Provides real-time captioning for live conversations, translating spoken language into text.

**Problems:**  
- **Text-Based Only:** Focuses solely on text captions without sign language translation.

### SignAll

**Usage:**  
Uses computer vision and machine learning to translate sign language into text and speech.

**Problems:**  
- **Cost:** High technology and service costs may limit accessibility.
- **Complexity:** Requires advanced hardware and software that may not be widely available.

## Summary

- Gnosys and HandTalk face issues with user discomfort and lack of audio output.
- SignAble is focused on video communication within the deaf community, without addressing translation needs.
- Audio to ISL App offers bidirectional translation but lacks automation and has limited recommendations.
- Ava and SignAll provide text-based and sign language translation but face accessibility and cost issues.
